    <h1>Kyle E. Mitchell</h1>
    <p>(Presented in the third person, by popular request.)</p>
    <p>Kyle began working life as a <a href="https://github.com/kemitchell">computer programmer</a>, building websites, content management systems, and educational multimedia with open source software.</p>
    <p>After a stint in Moscow, Russia studying software-copyright law and politics, he returned to <a href="https://utexas.edu">Texas</a> for graduate studies, and eventually law school. During law school, he made law review, failed to quit law review, built an analytics platform to predict citation-yield success of submitted articles, researched for the law schoolâ€™s securities regulation expert, and founded an open-legal-data not-for-profit, then shut it down when <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/projects/caselaw-access-project/">Harvard</a> got on it. Meantime, he spent a lot of time "borrowing" volumes of United States Reports, and trying to buy them cheap from dead law firms, courthouse libraries, and estate sales.</p>
    <p>Out of law school, Kyle joined the small Silicon Valley office of a large law firm, serving start-up to large technology companies with corporate, commercial, and intellectual property advice. The firm made him use Microsoft Windows. The firm would not let him use Dropbox.</p>
    <p>A year later, he left the firm to start his <a href="https://kemitchell.com">own practice</a>, focusing on start-up company representation, open source legal technology, developer tools companies, and open source software ecosystems. He <a href="https://linux.kemitchell.com">runs Debian again</a>.</p>
    <p>Along the way, he's released <a href="https://forms.kemitchell.com">several permissively licensed contract forms</a>, <a href="https://commonform.org">a suite of tools for contract preparation, automation, and sharing</a>, <a href="http://jslicense.org">popular tooling for automated license metadata management and audit in the JavaScript ecosystem</a>, and a <a href="https://publicdomainchronicle.org">distributed prior-art publication for securing scientific findings for the public domain</a>. He's launched two legal technology utility companies, <a href="https://rxnda.com">one for contract standardization and electronic signature</a>, <a href="https://licensezero.com">another for microscale commercial dual licensing of open software</a>. He's had a few hits on the <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com">blog</a>, mostly writing on open source software and legal technology, with the occasional dash of blockchain.</p>
    <p>He rebuilds forty-year-old motorcycles. He plays Travis style guitar, really badly. He hangs out at <a href="https://sudoroom.org">the local hackerspace in Oakland</a>.</p>
