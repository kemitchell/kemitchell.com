  <h1>Legal Notice</h1>

  <p>
    Unless and until we both sign an engagement letter, I am not your lawyer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Do <em>not</em> send me unsolicited messages with confidential info about your legal needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Donâ€™t rely on this site to make legal decisions. It takes a lawyer, your lawyer, to learn your situation, research the law, and provide good advice.
